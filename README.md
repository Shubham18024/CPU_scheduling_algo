# Kernel Behavior and Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains programs that explore Linux kernel behavior, memory management, and process scheduling algorithms. Ideal for students and developers interested in operating systems!

## Contents

- **Kernel Behavior**: Retrieve kernel version, CPU details, and memory statistics.
- **Memory Management**: Implement First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit allocation strategies.
- **File Operations**: Copy files using system calls.
- **Process Scheduling**: Analyze scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
